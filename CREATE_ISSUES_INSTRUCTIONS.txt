INSTRUCTIONS TO CREATE GITHUB ISSUES
================================================================================

The boilerplate code has been pushed to GitHub successfully!
Repository: https://github.com/Pulkit0111/meeting_notes_taker_sample_project

To create the 15 GitHub issues, follow these steps:

OPTION 1: Using Python Script (RECOMMENDED)
--------------------------------------------

   - Visit: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Name it: "Meeting Note Taker Issues"
   - Select scope: "repo" (full control of private repositories)
   - Click "Generate token"
   - COPY THE TOKEN (you won't see it again!)

2. Run the Python script:
   cd meeting-note-taker
   python3 create_github_issues.py YOUR_TOKEN_HERE

   Example:
   python3 create_github_issues.py ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

3. The script will create all 15 issues automatically!
